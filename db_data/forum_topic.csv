345,CPU-Z Benchmark Threadâ€‹,"<p>This thread is dedicated to the CPU-Z benchmark to encourage some friendly competition among our members. Anyone may share their results, but to be included in the leaderboard you must have at least 50 posts. I&#39;ve included a leaderboard of overall results as well as being broken down into desktops and laptops. I know other CPU benchmark threads exist on here but they&#39;re somewhat out of date at this point.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve opted for CPU-Z as my benchmarking tool because it&#39;s extremely quick to run, seems to scale well, and is built into software most of us already have. It is my benchmark and stress test of choice for overclocking as I can test stability quickly and easily. It&#39;s not the most hardcore benchmark around, but definitely the most usable for getting quick results.</p>

<p><strong>7/4/18 Update: These results are using CPU-Z Benchmark Version 17.01.64<br />
Please ensure you are on this version of the benchmark. If you&#39;re not the latest CPU-Z version should have it. Since I only have results for Desktops currently I will only post that. Once I get a few laptop runs I will make a graph for that as well as a combined one.</strong></p>

<p>Grab CPU-Z from here. <a href=""http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html"">Link</a></p>

<p><strong>Note: CPU-Z scores are noticeably impacted by programs running in the background like Steam, Skype, etc. Please shut down anything non essential when benching to ensure maximum results.</strong></p>

<p>To post your results please include the following in a screenshot. Open multiple instances of CPU-Z to make this easier.</p>

346,Are they the same?,"<p>I have a desktop that I want to upgrade the CPU. I want a Pentium D 960 but they are a bit expensive, at least the one&rsquo;s I can find. I have found some 950&rsquo;s but I have a question.</p>

<p>Pentium D 950 Xeon are a lot cheaper that the Pentium D 950 that is not labeled Xeon. Are the CPU&rsquo;s different or the same. Stupid question, to some perhaps, but I don&rsquo;t know the answer and can only ask those that does.</p>

<p>The Stylo 7 5G will reportedly launch with a 6.8-inch flat display and a hole-punch cutout for the front-facing camera. The previous model featured a waterdrop notch, so the design has been tweaked somewhat. The device&rsquo;s overall size is said to measure in at 170.4 x 77.2 x 8.8mm (10mm with the rear camera bump).</p>

(hope this is the proper place to post this, was not sure)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve recently reinstalled windows 10 on my Yoga 720-15IKB Laptop (ideapad) - Type 80x7 (to be exact ;) , bought in 2017 or 18&#39; and am wondering if and how should I update my drivers.<br />
This is a laptop made for work - audio editing and live performance so I try to keep it as stable and as clean as possible. I think I&#39;d like to skip vantage and not to have something excess on my machine. especially the kind that likes to run in the backround.<br />
The drivers listed on the Lenovo site are from 2018 tops. Should I download some drivers from straight from the manufacturer ? e.g. NVIDIA or Intel?<br />
<strong>Most importantly:</strong> should I download any additional drivers at all? everything seems to be working fine right now. there are some unkown devices in the device manager but I havn&#39;t encountered any problem so far.<br />
thx in advance,<br />

The issue is, it does not work anywhere else. For example if I move the mouse over the icons over the taskbar, I see them highlited which means it is responding but ramdomly it does not respond. I minimize my browser and try to left click and right click on my desktop and nothing. What I do to fix this is I bring up the taskbar with ctrl+alt+del and hit esc. I do this about 3-4 times and them the mouse works again. I&#39;ve been using windows for years and this is something totally new. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.<br />
