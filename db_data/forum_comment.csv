Purchased F1 2020, this is a racing game for serious drivers. Doesn&#39;t have the fun factor of Heat but you&#39;ll need to learn how to drive better and race according to F1 Rules. I&#39;m not very good at it yet but at least I am able to finish a race. Biggest challenge is learning to drive in a crowd of cars, because crashing will get you disqualified from the race.</p>

Problem is I shouldn&#39;t have to go to 1.325 for 4.9Ghz where as before I was getting 1.320 on 5.0Ghz. I am most likely going to request a replacement from intel. Besides it will give me something to do having to install a new CPU and all.</p>

174,"<p>While this &quot;Wall of Fire: has a high temp, you have to understand the difference between temperature and heat content.</p>

<p>Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles. &nbsp;Heat content is the total of the KE of the particles in a given volume.</p>

<p>Thus a volume that contains a lot of low temp particles can have a larger heat content than an equal volume with higher temp, but fewer particles.</p>

<p>Now while articles have described this wall as being of a &quot;high density&quot;, this is meant relative to the normal solar wind density of a few particles per cubic centimeter. &nbsp;This a much better vacuum that can be achieved by man on Earth by several magnitudes. &nbsp; This &quot;thick wall&quot; off plasma is a not that much less of a vacuum.</p>

<p>To melt a comet you need to add a fair amount of heat energy to it, and even at such a high temperature, this plasma has nowhere near the total heat content per cubic meter to do this.</p>

What is known of the composition of the interstellar winds generating the Wall, and does it experience any magnetochemistry or photochemistry within its interaction with the heliosphere?</p>
